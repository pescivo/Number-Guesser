# Number-Guesser-Game

Here is a summary of how this code works in practice:

There are three main variables: humanScore, computerScore, and currentRoundNumber. humanScore stores the score of the human player, computerScore stores the score of the computer, and currentRoundNumber keeps track of the current round number.

The generateTarget function is responsible for generating a random number between 0 and 9, which represents the target for the game. The goal for the players is to guess this number.

The compareGuesses function takes three parameters: humanGuess (the guess made by the human player), computerGuess (the guess made by the computer), and targetGuess (the target number generated by the generateTarget function). This function calculates the absolute difference between each player's guess and the target number. It then returns true if the human's difference is less than or equal to the computer's difference, otherwise it returns false.

The updateScore function takes a parameter winner, which indicates which player won the round. If winner is equal to 'human', the human player's score (humanScore) is incremented by 1. If winner is equal to 'computer', the computer's score (computerScore) is incremented by 1.

The advanceRound function is responsible for advancing to the next round. It increments the value of the currentRoundNumber variable by 1.

These functions can be used together to simulate multiple rounds of the game. In each round, the players make their guesses, the compareGuesses function determines the winner, the updateScore function updates the scores, and the advanceRound function moves to the next round.
